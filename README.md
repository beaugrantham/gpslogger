# GPSLogger

GPSLogger is an Android app that logs GPS information and has options for annotating and publishing.

This is a fork of [mendhak](https://github.com/mendhak)'s [gpslogger](https://github.com/mendhak/gpslogger) and is tailored for a specific usecase.

GPS points is stored in a local database and published via JSON to a custom webservice on a configurable interval. The application will attempt to re-publish points at a later time if it is unable to do so for whatever reason (no network connectivity, for example). This makes it ideal for long trips that cross in and out of coverage areas.
